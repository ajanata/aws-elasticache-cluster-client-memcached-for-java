# Why does this fork exist?

The Amazon AWS fork defaults to ClientMode.Dynamic, which breaks drop-in replacement while still supporting regular memcached nodes (either raw ElastiCache nodes, or honest-to-goodness memcached). That conflicts with how a project I'm working on is set up, so I'm changing the default to ClientMode.Static. I'm also fixing what looks like a bug where it ignores the default mode constant and hard-codes ClientMode.Dynamic in an alternate constructor.

# Amazon ElastiCache Cluster Client

Amazon ElastiCache Cluster Client is an enhanced Java library to connect to ElastiCache clusters. This client library has been built upon Spymemcached and is released under the [Amazon Software License](http://aws.amazon.com/asl/).

# Building

Amazon ElastiCache Cluster Client can be compiled using Apache Ant by running the following
command:

    ant

This will generate binary, source, and javadoc jars in the build
directory of the project.

More test info will be updated shortly.

# Testing

_Note: The ant test target is in the process of being updated to run the additional tests written for Auto Discovery._

The latest version of Amazon ElastiCache Cluster Client has a set of command line arguments
that can be used to configure the location of your testing server. The
arguments are listed below.

    -Dserver.address_v4=ipv4_address_of_testing_server

This argument is used to specify the ipv4 address of your testing
server. By default it is set to localhost.

    -Dserver.port_number=port_number_of_memcached

This argument is used when memcahched is started on a port other than
11211

    -Dtest.type=ci

This argument is used for CI testing where certain unit tests might
be temporarily failing.
